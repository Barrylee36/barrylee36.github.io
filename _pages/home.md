## Welcome!


Howdy! My name is **Cheng-Chun Lee**, also go by **Barry**. I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at <a href='https://www.urbanresilience.ai/' target='_blank'>Urban Resilience.AI Lab</a> work with Dr. Mostafavi. Before I joined the research group, I received My Ph.D. degree in Zachry Department of Civil Engineering at Texas A&M University in May 2021 supervised by <a href='https://ceprofs.civil.tamu.edu/ngharaibeh/' target='_blank'>Dr. Nasir Gharaibeh</a>. I obtained My master’s degree in Civil Engineering specializing in Transportation Engineering at National Taiwan University, and bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering at National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan. My research interest lies in enhancing resilience and intelligence of civil infrastructure systems by incorporating various approaches, including remote sensing, artificial intelligence, data science, and machine learning.
